## Git convention

+ **Add:** - new functionality has been added
+ **Change:** - changes in methods/variables
+ **Delete:** - something has been removed
+ **Fixed:** - repaired has been performed
+ **Refactor:** - reserved for future possible refactoring, in essence whilst moving to Phaser 3/ECMAScript 6

## Code convention

+ 2 spaces (tab)
+ Commas at the closing curly brace of a function
+ Empty line at the end of a file
+ Object literals style
+ Single quotes for strings
+ Spaces before curly braces, parentheses in functions, as well arguments of functions should be with spaces, example: **preload: function (arg1, arg2, ...) { ... };**

## Technological stack

+ Apache Cordova
+ ECMAScript 5
+ Gulp 3
+ Phaser 2
